# **Scientific Calculator :**

### *This Gui is built with Python programming and TKinter modules.*

## **Speciality :**

- This calculator has two virtual screens. Which will be very useful when we do a difficult calculation or a calculation with a difficult and different functions.
- This calculator can be used to calculate trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, tan, and inverse trigonometric functions.
- The factorial value of a number can also be found out. 
- Special arrangements have been made to solve the problem of permutation and combination. 
- With this calculator, we will be able to find logarithms with base 10,  base "e" and also with any base as you like.

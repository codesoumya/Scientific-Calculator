# **Scientific Calculator :**

### *This Gui is built with Python programming and TKinter modules.*

## **Speciality :**

- This calculator has two virtual screens. Which will be very useful when we do a difficult calculation or a calculation with a difficult and different functions.
- This calculator can be used to calculate trigonometric functions such as sin, cos, tan, and inverse trigonometric functions.
- The factorial value of a number can also be found out. 
- Special arrangements have been made to solve the problem of permutation and combination. 
- With this calculator, we will be able to find logarithms with base 10,  base "e" and also with any base as you like.
-  Also, despite all these , we can find the square, cube, square root, cube root, etc. values of a number directly.

## **_To use this sofware follow the procedur given bellow :_**

### **How to solve normal math problem?**
*To solve the problem of summetion, substraction, multipicatio and division follow the rules bellow*

- **STEP 1** At first take a number from the key pad
- **STEP 2** Next choose the function that you want
- **STEP 3** Next take the Second number
- **STEP 4** Now Press the _"="_button to get result
- **_To clear the screen prees "c" button and if you want to use backspace press ".del" button_**

### **How to solve the problems of trigonometric function's ?**
*To solve the problem of sin(0), cos(0), tan(0) and the inverse of these follow the rules*
**the value of 0(theta) should be in deegres and you will get the value from inverse function also be in deegres**

- **STEP 1** At first press the function button that you want
- **STEP 2** Next press the value of 0(theta) from keypad
- **STEP 3** At last press the **"="** button to get Answer

### **How to evaluate the value of squere, qube, squere root and qube root and factorial of any number?**

- **STEP 1** At first type the test number
- **Step 2** Press the functional button that you want
- **_for this, it is not nessary to click on "=" button_**

### **How get the value of log(_base "e"_), log(_base "10"_), and nth power of e ?**
*This procedure is similer to trigo functions*
